### System.mkdir(String, Number: mode -> Optional) -> Result\<Nil>

Make directory.
Returns a Result type and on success will unwrap nil.

It can take an optional number argument that specifies the mode. If a mode is not passed, the directory will be created with `0777` permissions.

```cs
const
    S_IRWXU = System.S_IRWXU,
    S_IRGRP = System.S_IRGRP,
    S_IXGRP = System.S_IXGRP,
    S_IROTH = System.S_IROTH,
    S_IXOTH = System.S_IXOTH;

System.mkdir(dir, S_IRWXU|S_IRGRP|S_IXGRP|S_IXOTH|S_IROTH);
```

### System.mkdirAll(String, Number: mode -> Optional) -> Result\<Nil>

Make all directories for a given path.
Returns a Result type and on success will unwrap nil.

It can take an optional number argument that specifies the mode. If a mode is not passed, the directory will be created with `0777` permissions.

The actual permissions is modified by the process umask, which typically is S_IWGRP\|S_IWOTH (octal 022).

### System.access(String, Number) -> Result\<Nil>
